# A/B Testing for User Interface Optimization

### Overview

This project evaluates the impact of a redesigned User Interface (UI) on the online process for clients at Vanguard, a US-based investment management company. The objective is to determine whether a more user-friendly and modern UI can enhance the overall user experience and encourage more clients to complete the process.

### A/B Test Details
**Duration:** from 15/03/2017 to 20/06/2017 (4 months)

- **Control Group:** Clients interacted with Vanguardâ€™s traditional online process.

- **Test Group:** Clients experienced the new, spruced-up digital interface.

Both groups navigated through an identical process sequence: an initial page, three subsequent steps, and finally, a confirmation page signaling process completion.

### Initial Data Sets
To perform analysis, [three datasets](https://github.com/data-bootcamp-v4/lessons/tree/main/5_6_eda_inf_stats_tableau/project/files_for_project) are provided:
1. **Client Profiles (df_final_demo)**: Demographics like age, gender, and account details of our clients.
2. **Digital Footprints (df_final_web_data)**: A detailed trace of client interactions online, divided into two parts: pt_1 and pt_2. 
3. **Experiment Roster (df_final_experiment_clients)**: A list revealing which clients were part of test and contro groups.


Performed data cleaning and analysis on online user activity data.
Defined key performance indicators (KPIs) for relative measurements.
Conducted A/B testing to evaluate UI performance by comparing test and control groups using new and old versions.

Would these changes encourage more clients to complete the process? Did the new UI lead to higher completion rates?
